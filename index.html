<h2>Waste Wizard Fusion Model</h2>
<p>
  Sleek stainless steel, modern version of the outdated trashcan. Containing an LCD screen in the front 
  and a glass panel to watch motors; as well as a camera and raspberrypi inside. This is truly 
  the most magical of trashcans.

<p>
  One large, modern centralized trashcan that holds three seperate smaller bins. One for compost, one for recycling, one for trash.
  The process is to: 
  <ul>
    <li>Scan QR Code</li>
    <li>Scan waste -> the Waste Wizard will open the door after classifying waste</li>
    <li>The slides visible in the glass, will then move depending on the classification</li>
    <li>If the classification is normal trash; it will move the right most slide down, which will 
      create a slide for the trash to enter the right most bin.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <b>
  <ul>Objectives:
  </b>
    <li>Encourage employee participation in Zero Waste efforts.</li>
    <li>Minimize risk of contamination.</li>
    <li>Increase accuracy of waste measurements.</li>
    <li>Minimize errors in waste disposal system.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
  <ul>Benefits:
  </b>
    <li>Reduce outsorcing and sorting costs.</li>
    <li>Reduce contamination fee costs.</li>
    <li>Instantly reach 90% waste diversion rate.</li>
    <li>Increased employee particpation and community.</li>
    <li>Easier to identify cause behind lowered diversion rate.</li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="info">Information:</h4>
<p>
  Zero waste is difficult to achieve, the waste disposal system is 
  inconvenient and confusing. The lack of convenience, and the lack of motivation 
  is the reason that only <b>5-6% of plastic was recycled nationally</b>. 
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to encourage, incentivize, and progress zero waste efforts. We believe that corporate buildings,
  community living areas, and schools are the best places to place the Waste Wizard. 
  In this way, Cox can employ zero waste efforts all around them, instead of only the office.
  If apartments, schools, and even cities, were to adapt the Waste Wizard and incentive programs, we can really make
  some real headway in zero waste and enviornmental practices.
</p>
<p>
  The Waste Wizard is useful becuase it reduces the risk of contamination, especially in
  single stream recycling, and material restortaion factores. Currently, <b>over 27% of single stream recycling in MRFs are contaminated</b>. 
  Reducing contamination, encouraging recycling, and targeting community settings is 
  excactly why the Waste Wizard is amazing.
</p>
<p>
  This is not just an intelligent trashcan; it is a trashcan that has the 
  ability to bring people together and create communities. There is strength 
  in numbers, and only through community and group efforts will we be able to save 
  enviornment.
